# Welcome to the Riot-AP(Y)!
This project was meant to make interacting with the Riot API ([https://developer.riotgames.com/](https://developer.riotgames.com/)) *ridiculously* easy.  

Most other solutions out there require you to run web-apps, or install full applications - this is meant to cut through all the nonsense and supply plug-and-play Python functions to quickly access the data you want to tinker with!

## How to use this:
 1. Have Python
 2. Clone or download this project
 3. Either create a new file in the folder and `import stats`, or work in the `stats.py` file
 4. If you haven't already, sign-up for a Riot developer account
 5. Place your API key (found at [https://developer.riotgames.com/](https://developer.riotgames.com/)) in a file titled `key.txt` in the same folder as everything else

## To-do list:
* Tests
* More functionality (i.e. more endpoints)

## Politics n' stuff
This is not affiliated with Riot Games, it just uses their open endpoints.
